## Kicad Checklist for Manufacturing with JLPCB

- [ ] Design schematic should be complete and error-free, ensuring all components are correctly placed and connected.
- [ ] Design footprints for each component have been created or verified against manufacturer's guidelines.
- [ ] All passive and active components have their values correctly labeled.
- [ ] Component placements and routing follow the manufacturer's recommendations and design rules.
- [ ] Board layout adheres to the required standards (size, thickness, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure there are no unconnected nets or floating nodes on the board.
- [ ] Verify all power and ground connections are robust and able to handle the expected current.
- [ ] Designated areas for mounting holes are present and marked correctly in the design files.
- [ ] Create a Bill of Materials (BOM) including part numbers, quantities, and references using the KiCad tool.
- [ ] Include any necessary decals or silkscreen text on the board layout.
- [ ] Generate Gerber files from the PCB new tool in KiCad for manufacturing. These should include: top copper layer, bottom copper layer, drill holes, edge cuts, and other necessary layers as per your design.
- [ ] Check that the Gerber files are free of errors and contain all required information.
- [ ] Ensure the Gerber file format matches the manufacturer's requirements (e.g., RS-274X).
- [ ] Save a copy of all design files in a safe location for future reference.
- [ ] Submit the necessary manufacturing files to the selected PCB manufacturer, ensuring they are properly labeled and identified.
- [ ] Verify that the manufacturer has received all required information and files.
- [ ] Follow up with the manufacturer to ensure your order is being processed as expected.
