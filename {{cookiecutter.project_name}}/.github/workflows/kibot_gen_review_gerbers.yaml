# This workflow generates Gerbers for reviewing before release.
# The version number and date of the design is automatically updated on the PCB.
# The version number is set via an environment variable
# and by default is `gerb-review` since this runs outside of the release process
# so there's no formal release number to use.

# To use this workflow in your own repo you need to edit the timezone in the environment variables in the env: section
# below.
